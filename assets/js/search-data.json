We argue that the number of infected in the past can be infered using today&#39;s number of deaths and average fatality rate from confirmed cases in the following way: . $$ I_{t-j} = frac{D_t}{{CFR}_t}$$ . where $I_t$ = number of infected, $D_t$ = number of deaths, and ${CFR}_t $ = case fatality rate = $ frac{D}{C}$. The $j$ depends on the average number of days that covid patients die after having the first symptoms. . Assumption 1: The case fatality rate is a good proxy for the fatality rate of the infected population . Then, in order to estimate the current number of infected $I_t$ we need to estimate its growth rate from $t-j$ to $t$. . $$I_t = (1+ hat{g})^j I_{t-j}$$ . Assumption 2: The growth rate of infected $ hat{g}$ is an unbiased estimate of $g$ . . For now we estimate $g$ using the average growth rate since having the first infected person. . Assumption 3: It takes on average 8 days to die after having the first symptoms. . This analysis was conducted by Joao B. Duarte.

Plotted is the estimated relationship between test capacity (in terms of people per test -- larger = less testing) and the likelihood a COVID-19 case is reported (lower = more under-reporting of cases). . The lines represent the posterior samples from our MCMC run (note the x-axis is plotted on a log scale). The rug plot shows the current test capacity for each state (black &#39;|&#39;) and the capacity one week ago (cyan &#39;+&#39;). For comparison, South Korea&#39;s testing capacity is currently at the very left of the graph (200 people per test). . About this Analysis . This analysis was done by Joseph Richards. . This project1 uses the testing rates per state from https://covidtracking.com/, which reports case counts and mortality by state. This is used to estimate the number of unreported (untested) COVID-19 cases in each U.S. state. . The analysis makes a few assumptions: . The probability that a case is reported by a state is a function of the number of tests run per person in that state. Hence the degree of under-reported cases is a function of tests run per capita. | The underlying mortality rate is the same across every state. | Patients take time to succumb to COVID-19, so the mortality counts today reflect the case counts 7 days ago. E.g., mortality rate = (cumulative deaths today) / (cumulative cases 7 days ago). | The model attempts to find the most likely relationship between state-wise test volume (per capita) and under-reporting, such that the true underlying mortality rates between the individual states are as similar as possible. The model simultaneously finds the most likely posterior distribution of mortality rates, the most likely true case count per state, and the test volume vs. case underreporting relationship. . . Full details about the model are available at: https://github.com/jwrichar/COVID19-mortality&#8617; . |",

This analysis was done by Thomas Wiecki. Interactive visualizations were created by Hamel Husain. . The model that we are building assumes exponential growth. This is definitely wrong because growth would just continue uninterrupted into the future. However, in the early phase of an epidemic it&#39;s a reasonable assumption.1 . We assume a negative binomial likelihood as we are dealing with count data. A Poisson could also be used but the negative binomial allows us to also model the variance separately to give more flexibility. . The model is also hierarchical, pooling information from individual countries. . .

About This Analysis . This analysis was done by Joseph Richards . In this project1, we attempt to estimate the true mortality rate2 for COVID-19 while controlling for country-level covariates34 such as: . age of outbreak in the country | transparency of the country&#39;s government | access to healthcare | demographics such as age of population and rural vs. urban | . Estimating a mortality rate lower than the overall reported rate likely implies that there has been significant under-testing and under-reporting of cases globally. . Interpretation of Country-Level Parameters . days_since_first_case - positive (very statistically significant). As time since outbreak increases, expected mortality rate increases, as expected. | cpi - negative (statistically significant). As government transparency increases, expected mortality rate decreases. This may mean that less transparent governments under-report cases, hence inflating the mortality rate. | healthcare avg. out-of-pocket spending - no significant trend. | hospital beds per capita - no significant trend. | Human Capital Index - no significant trend (slightly negative = mortality rates decrease with increased mobilization of the country) | percent over 65 - positive (statistically significant). As population age increases, the mortality rate also increases, as expected. | percent rural - no significant trend. | . Full details about the model are available at: https://github.com/jwrichar/COVID19-mortality&#8617; . | As of March 10, the overall reported mortality rate is 3.5%. However, this figure does not account for systematic biases in case reporting and testing. The observed mortality of COVID-19 has varied widely from country to country (as of early March 2020). For instance, as of March 10, mortality rates have ranged from &lt; 0.1% in places like Germany (1100+ cases) to upwards of 5% in Italy (9000+ cases) and 3.9% in China (80k+ cases).&#8617; . | The point of our modelling work here is to try to understand and correct for the country-to-country differences that may cause the observed discrepancies in COVID-19 country-wide mortality rates. That way we can &quot;undo&quot; those biases and try to pin down an overall real mortality rate.&#8617; . | The affects of these parameters are subject to change as more data are collected.&#8617; . | Appendix: Model Diagnostics . The following trace plots help to assess the convergence of the MCMC sampler. .",

This project is supported by a virtual team of open source collaborators that gather data, make visualizations and perform analysis regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. We saw that data scientists were struggling to share information with each other, so we used this project to aid in the sharing of data and information.
